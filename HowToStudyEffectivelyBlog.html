                Its easy if you follow these tips. By using all these techniques, I am able

            <h1>Tip#1: Pay attention to your Teacher during class</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="img-01">
            <img src="img/teacher.webp" height="300" width="300"></div>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                Many times, student don't focus on their classes but it is important to make sure
                that you pay attention to your teacher. Don't be distracted during your classes and 
                make sure you have understood everything what teacher has taught in the class. So, if you 
                open your book, you don't feel that this is something new.
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <h1>Tip#2: Take notes</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="img-01">
                <img src="img/notes.png" height="300" width="300"></div>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                Its very obvious but many students tend to avoid this step. There are many reasons 
                like many of us tend to be lazy during the classes or else we feel that taking notes
                is not important. But it really is! Always take notes during your classes for future 
                revision and keep them safely in a safe place so you don't have to find them during your 
                exam week. You have to make the notes in such a way that you don't need to open your
                book before the exam. I will also be writing a blog on How to take notes, so till then 
                stay tuned!
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <h1>Tip#3: Go through each topic twice or thrice(if possible)</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="img-01">
                <img src="img/books.jpeg" height="300" width="300"></div>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                Go through all the chapters of your textbook at least twice and understand it 
                well. If you don't, try taking help from your teacher, or your friends or from 
                youtube. There are many useful youtube videos for almost each chapter. After you
                have finished reading the chapters, make notes while you study. So you will have 
                two notes in hand, one that you made during class and one that you made by your own.
                The good thing is that if you have missed any lecture so you can make your notes by your own. 
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <h1>Tip#4: Solve the question/answers</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="img-01">
                <img src="img/qa.png" height="300" width="300"></div>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                After a clear review of a chapter and making notes, you will be able to solve questions
                on your own. Try practicing question/answers from different sources like from refreshers, 
                from different websites and many more. Practice all type of questions: Objective, fill ups,
                true false, very short, long, etc. Also solve some sample papers and assest yourself. In this, 
                you will be able to find your strengths and weaknesses and can also work on your weaknesses 
                by re-reviewing the topic. 
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <h1>Tip#5: Revision</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="img-01">
                <img src="img/Revision.jpg" height="300" width="300"></div>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                Never forget to revise a topic because as per a study conducted, we tend to forget things
                which we learn within 3 days. Let us take a practical example, You have studied a chapter thouroughly
                and have also reviewed the notes. The day you studied the chapter, your knowledge is 100%. But in
                the second day, it drops down to 70% and 30% on the third day. After three days, it is zero. So what
                you need to do is that revise the topic you study every fourth day to make your knowledge about
                the topic from 0 to 100 again. 
            </p>

        <h1>Tip#6: Teach others</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="img-01">
            <img src="img/TO.jpg" height="300" width="300"></div>
        <br> <br>
        <p>This is the most useful tip. After you are thorough with a particular topic, teach it
            to your friend or you can teach it to yourself in the mirror. Believe me, if you follow 
            this tip then you are most-likely to ace in a particular topic.
